0-positive_or_negative.c
The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program. if the number is greater than 0: is positive, if the number is 0: is zero, if the number is less than 0: is negative
1-last_digit.c
This program will affect a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.The output of the program should be: Last digit of, followed the number, followed by is, followed by if the number is greater than 5: and is greater than 5, if the number is 0: and is 0, if the number is less than 6 and not 0: and is less than 6 and not 0, followed by a new line
2-print_alphabet.c
Prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
3-print_alphabets.c
Prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
4-print_alphabt.c
Prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. Only use putchar(), printf, puts, etc are forbidden. Only use putchar twice.
5-print_numbers.c
Prints all numbers of base 10, starting from 0, followed by a new line.
6-print_numberz.c
Prints all numbers of base 10, starting from 0, followed by a new line.
You are not allowed to use any variable of type char. You can only use the putchar function (every other functions (printf, puts, etc...) are forbidden). You can only use putchar twice in your code

7-print_tebahpla.c
Prints the alphabet, in reverse order, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
8-print_base64.c
Prints all the numbers of base64, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
9-print_comb.c
Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
Numbers must be separated by , , followed by a space in ascending order. You can only use the putchar function (every other functions (printf, puts, etc...) are forbidden). All your code should be in the main function. You can only use putchar four times maximum in your code. You are not allowed to use any variable of type char.

10-print_comb2.c
Prints numbers from 0 to 99.0-positive_or_negative.c
